Hi there 👋

I'm Miguel, a mobile developer who loves building clean, intuitive apps — especially with Flutter.
I enjoy creating things that feel good to use and learning new ways to make apps smarter and more helpful.

Right now, I’m also learning machine learning, simply because I’m curious and love expanding my toolkit — no specific goal, just exploring and growing.

I’ve worked on production apps across Flutter, Android, and iOS, and I care a lot about good architecture, smooth UX, and shipping things that actually help people.

If you want to connect or check out what I’m building, feel free to reach out or explore my work here. 😊

• Hobbies: Gym, running and playing video games
